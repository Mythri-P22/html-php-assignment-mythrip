1) Purpose:

PHP sessions are used to store and manage user data across multiple pages during a single visit (session) to a website.

2) Functionality:

session_start() begins a new or resumes an existing session.

PHP assigns a unique session ID to each user.

Data is stored on the server in the $_SESSION superglobal.

Session data persists across pages until the session ends or is destroyed

3) Application: Maintaining a Shopping Cart

Start session: session_start();

Add item: $_SESSION['cart'][] = "Product A";

Access cart: $_SESSION['cart']

Cart stays available across all pages during the session.

EXAMPLE:
session_start();
$_SESSION['cart'][] = "Product A";  // Add item

// Display cart
foreach ($_SESSION['cart'] as $item) {
    echo $item . "<br>";
}
