Steps to get file name from a path in PHP:

1)Store the full file path in a variable.

2)Use the basename() function with the path variable as argument.

3)basename() returns the file name with extension.

4)(Optional) Use pathinfo() with PATHINFO_FILENAME to get file name without extension.

EXAMPLE:
$path = "/folder/subfolder/file.txt";
$fileName = basename($path);  // "file.txt"
$fileNameNoExt = pathinfo($path, PATHINFO_FILENAME);  // "file"
